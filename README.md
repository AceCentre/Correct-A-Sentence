# Correct-A-Sentence

A really simple REST API to take a string which may have no spaces in it, find the word segments, correct it and then capitlaise it correctly

Note: We are using not just accurate spellings of words but a largish corpus of spelling mistakes too (see below for sources). This is probably making the word segmentation worse than better. Needs testing
